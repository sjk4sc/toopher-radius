	#  proxy accounting packets as part of normal processing.
	#  Then, if the home server goes down, accounting packets can
	#  be logged to a local "detail" file, for processing with
	#  radrelay.  When the home server comes back up, radrelay
	#  will read the detail file, and send the packets to the
	#  home server.
	#
	#  With this configuration, the server always responds to
	#  Accounting-Requests from the NAS, but only writes
	#  accounting packets to disk if the home server is down.
